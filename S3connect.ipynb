The set of headers you can override using these parameters is a subset of the headers that Amazon S3 accepts when you create an object. The response headers that you can override for the GET response are ``Content-Type`` , ``Content-Language`` , ``Expires`` , ``Cache-Control`` , ``Content-Disposition`` , and ``Content-Encoding`` . To override these header values in the GET response, you use the following request parameters.\n",
